<h2>The 4th International Conference on Universal Village (UV 2018)</h2>
<h2>Special Session on</h2>
<h2>Effective Microorganisms Technology</h2>
<p>Organizer: Masaki Shintani</p>
<p>Recent studies show microorganisms have populated, dominated, and even shaped our planet for over 3.5 billion years. These facts suggest that it is hardly possible to build the Universal Village without understanding the real roles of microorganisms and microbiome. This session will explore the enormous potential of microbial technology, especially focusing on the effective microorganisms technology, and also discuss different usage examples of the technology around the world.</p>
