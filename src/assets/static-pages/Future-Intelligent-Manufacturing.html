<h2 align="CENTER">The 4th International Conference on Universal Village (UV 2018)</h2>
<h2 align="CENTER"></h2>
<h2 align="CENTER">Special Session on</h2>
<h2 align="center">Future Intelligent Manufacturing</h2>
<h2 align="center"></h2>
<p>In today’s society, manufacturing industries play a key role in our sustenance, providing us with all the modern
    capabilities and comfort that we have grown accustomed to, and rely upon. Recently, the industry is experiencing the
    challenges of increasing need for both personalized product from customers and high efficiency of manufacturing.
    Furthermore, wastage from manufacturing has been imposing adverse effect on the environment, and jeopardizing the
    human-nature harmony. It is imperative to address these challenges, to increase efficiency of manufacturing lines
    and expensive machines, to improve quality control, and to minimize wastages. The special session is expected to
    call for collective effort and to develop new systematic solutions.</p>
<p><strong>1) Computer vision</strong></p>
<p>Computer vision has been with us since the early 1950’s, but it really gained momentum in the last 20 years with the
    emergence of the concept of machine vision, and started to become very important for improving the intelligence of
    manufacturing.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">For Quality Control:</p>
<p>Machine vision has integrated itself into the manufacturing industry, providing greater automation options, better
    fault detection, sort products and perform tasks more efficiently than humans. Traditionally, quality control is
    done by humans, but introduction of machine vision has ensured increase in inspection rate and reduction in human
    error leading to better accuracy.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">For Waste Management:</p>
<p>Recently machine vision starts to play an important role in recycling, minimizing product wastage， clean
    manufacturing, etc.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">For Line Optimization:</p>
<p>In addition to product quality control, machine vision can be used as a sensing technology in numerous scenarios in
    the manufacturing lifecycle, like assembling, sorting, loading and unloading of materials or parts, drilling,
    welding etc.</p>
<p><strong>2) Cloud Manufacturing</strong></p>
<p>Currently, as a new service-oriented networked intelligent manufacturing paradigm, cloud manufacturing has attracted
    people’s attention. Cloud manufacturing pools manufacturing resources and capabilities via Internet and IoT into the
    cloud to provide high-quality manufacturing services on demand for the whole life cycle of manufacturing. A cloud
    manufacturing platform can also be used to collect data about location and state of distributed manufacturing
    equipment’s, to be used for remote monitoring, detecting, tracking and control. The cloud manufacturing platform
    enables that manufacturing procedures can be managed and monitored remotely and the expensive manufacturing
    resources and capabilities can be shared seamlessly.</p>
<strong>3) System Design</strong>
<br>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) have brought about a technological revolution in the manufacturing system. When
    designing a manufacturing system, AI can be involved during all the stages: design, prototype, procurement, material
    handling, processing, storage system, marketing, and collecting data from manufacturing as well as customer
    feedback, etc. With the help of AI, intelligent manufacturing system requires the least amount of human intervene,
    can accomplish complicated tasks efficiently and safely, and enables fast responses to customers’ need.</p>
<p>In summary, this session will concentrate on the emerging computer vision, cloud manufacturing and other system
    technologies that address the following challenges, but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;">a) Diagnostic tool to detect equipment malfunction;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;">b) Detect and remove non-compliant product;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;">c) Management of manufacturing lifecycle, like assembling, sorting, loading and unloading of materials or parts, drilling, welding etc.;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;">d) Reduce material consumption and product wastage during production; </p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;">e) Decrease environmental pollution</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;">f) Human-machine interface, efficiency &amp; quality control,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;">g) Cloud manufacturing services, such as cloud design, planning and scheduling, simulation, maintenance, monitoring, detecting, tracking and control of distributed manufacturing equipment and production process;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;">h) Automation of assembly lines, future autonomous factories, framework of future intelligent manufacturing.</p>
