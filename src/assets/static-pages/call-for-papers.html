<h1><strong>CALL FOR PAPERS</strong></h1>
<p>The International Conference on Universal Village, now in its 4th year, is established as the premier venue in exemplifying a desired future society that pursues human-nature harmony through the wise use of technologies. Universal Village concept signifies that we should follow the law of universe, protect environment/eco-system, understand humans' need in depth, and innovate new lifestyles, thus providing sustainable happiness for humanity's future. UV2018, to be held on October 23-24th, 2018 in Boston, USA, will provide leading edge, scholarly sessions for researchers, engineers, and students alike to share their state-of-the-art research and development work in the broad areas in developing Universal Village. The conference will feature a diverse mixture of interactive sessions: core technical sessions of high quality cutting-edge research articles; inspiring keynote speeches; insightful panel discussions from domain experts; and posters representing emerging ideas. UV2018 expected to call for collective effort across multi-disciplinary fields in order to develop collaboration platform, and to find a systematic, coordinated, long-term solution for future. The theme for UV2018 is "Diversity, Mobility and Connectivity for Emergence of Harmony in Universal Village."</p>
